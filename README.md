::::::::Story:::::::: 

You are the most evil villain and king of the goblins named Grakkor. Just a few hours ago you kidnapped the princess. Too bad that the King knows you very well ... and where your dungeon is located 

He has send 9 Armies to bring his daughter safely back. 

And that is exactly what you have to prevent. I mean it's YOUR princess, right? Exactly! 

You have 3 loyal minions that will fight for you until the end. Defeat all 9 Armies and the princess will be yours. You lose the princess if the knights can free her or if all your minions are dead. Good luck! 




::::::::Game Instructions::::::::: 

(Hint: There is a instruction menu on the titlescreen) 
- Select a minion by clicking on it 
- Move the minion by clicking on the destination 
- Fight your opponents by standing next to them 
- Pick up upgrades by standing next to them 
- The princess is located at the center of the map, protect her! 

IMPORTANT: You don't have to intercept the enemies. They have a 2 tile wide radius. If your minion is within that radius they will automaticly attack you. You could say that they have the ability to attract them. 

Update: 
Since someone was asking what the upgrades do: The "shield" upgrade increases your maximum health. The "sword" upgrade increases your damage. The hearts just heal you :)
